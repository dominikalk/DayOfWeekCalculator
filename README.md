# DayOfWeekCalculator

- Java - OOP course work part I - Calculates day of week from given date
- Linked to part II, which delves into object oriented programming more by implementing key concepts -  [DayFrequencyCalculator](https://github.com/dominikalk/DayFrequencyCalculator)

This repo was completed for a University course work focussing on OOP. It's based around a `SimpleDate` object that houses information on a date, and the main class containing methods that use dates to work out the day of the week for it. It also contains methods that are used in part II of the course work. To run the program run:
```
javac Test.java
java Test
or 
java Test <Day of week in form "Mon", "Tue" etc.>
```
The program does not contain much exception handling and the `Test.java` file is just there to test the methods in the class rather than being user friendly as the class only exists as a submission of the methods and to be used in part II.
